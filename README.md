## Performed LSTM modelling on a 6 month sales transaction dataset as a part of learning process of time-series forecasting. "LSTM for All Days" file models LSTM using the entire dataset from April 2019 to September 2019 to predict and forecast for the months of October, November and December while "LSTM for Weekdays" does the same for the same dataset but only for weekdays and not weekends.
## LSTM performs very well in forecasting the time-series data.

## Currently working on ARIMA and XGBoost models to compare the performance of all three.
